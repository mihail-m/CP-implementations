## Shortest Path Faster Algorithm (SPFA)
- Find the shortes path to every vertex from a starting vertex s in a weighted graph.

- O(VE) complexity but works in O(E) in many caces.

- SPFA is a improvement of the Bellman-Ford algorithm which takes advantage of the fact that not all attempts at relaxation will work. The main idea is to create a queue containing only the vertices that were relaxed but that still could further relax their neighbors. And whenever you can relax some neighbor, you should put him in the queue.
